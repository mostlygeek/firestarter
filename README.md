OSX tool for starting Firefox.  

## Why? 

Been using [multifirefox](https://github.com/mostlygeek/MultiFirefox/) for years and a modern version would be really useful.  Especially since I've started my personal profile with Nightly and had to restore it from backup too many times. 

## Features 

- dialpad? like UI for starting Firefox
- create a new selection of:  Firefox (release, beta, nightly) + Profile
- starts the Firefox profile manager to manage profiles
